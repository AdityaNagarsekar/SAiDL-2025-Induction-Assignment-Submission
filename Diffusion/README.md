# Diffusion Models Assignment

This directory contains my submission for the Diffusion Models task as part of the SAiDL Spring Assignment 2025.

## Overview

This project explores implementation and optimization techniques for diffusion-based generative models, focusing on:

1. Implementing and analyzing Diffusion Transformers (DiT)
2. Applying Sliding Window Attention (SWA) to improve model performance
3. Generating and evaluating image samples

The code is implemented in Python using PyTorch, with detailed methodology and results in the report.
